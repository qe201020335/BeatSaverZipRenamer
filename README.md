# BeatSaverZipRenamer
A tool to rename the hash named file download from new beatsaver as the "old way"

Also works on the files download from bsaber

Previously, before Beatsaver's ownership transfer, the map download will have a nice name like `28c5 (NUCLEAR-STAR - hexagonial).zip`. 
After the transfer, we have file name like `762b7bf1c06dbcc7aab23d955a553e5420fba6e5.zip`.
I don't like this because this hash name doesn't give me any information about the map. Hence I made this tool.

**Map files downloaded from other platform such as `bsaber.com` also works.**


## HOW TO USE
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/qe201020335/BeatSaverZipRenamer/releases/latest) and extract all.
2. Drag the files and folders you want to rename onto `BeatSaverZipRenamer.exe`
3. Wait for the program to finish.
